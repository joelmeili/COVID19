# COVID19
An attempt to model the COVID19 data from the ![Johns Hopkins Github Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData) by a SIRD model for various countries such as Germany, Switzerland and the US. This Github repository contains a shiny app and a presentation that illustrates the basic principles which were used to simulate the spread of the disease and also the estimation process of the SIRD model.
